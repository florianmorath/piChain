    module. This allows to directly call functions like broadcast and respond from the networking module and to override
    the receive-methods which are called in the networking module based on the type of the message.

    Args:
        node_index (int): the index of this node into the peers dictionary. The entry defines its ip address and port.
        peers_dict (dict): a dict containing the (ip, port) pairs for all nodes (see examples folder for its structure).

    Attributes:
        state (int): 0,1 or 2 corresponds to QUICK, MEDIUM or SLOW.
        blocktree (Blocktree): The blocktree which this node owns.
        known_txs (set): all txs seen so far. Set of txn ids.
        new_txs (list): txs not yet in a block, behaving like a queue.
        oldest_txn (Transaction): txn which started a timeout.
        s_max_block_depth (int):  depth of deepest block seen in round 1 (like T_max).
        s_prop_block (Block): stored block from a valid propose message.
        s_supp_block (Block): block supporting proposed block (like T_store).
        c_new_block (Block): block which client (a quick node) wants to commit next.
        c_com_block (Block): temporary compromise block.
        c_request_seq (int): voting round number.
        c_votes (int): used to check if majority is already reached.
        c_prop_block (Block): propose block with deepest support block the client has seen in round 2.
        c_supp_block (Block): support block supporting c_prop_block.
        c_quick_proposing (bool): a node may skip round 1 if his ticket is still valid.
        c_commit_running (bool): True if a commit currently running.
        c_current_committable_block (Block): block to still be committed
        tx_committed (Callable): method given by app service that is called once a transaction has been committed.
        rtts (dict): Mapping from peer_node_id to RTT. Used to estimate expected round trip time.
        expected_rtt (float): based on this rtt the timeouts are computed.
        slow_timeout_backoff (float): fix additional timeout backoff of a slow node (u.a.r only set once).
        n (int): total numberof nodes.
        retry_commit_timeout_queued (bool): is there a timeout in queue that will retry to commit.
